          Always this dreaded statement when trying to decide where to go.

        &quot;Huh, here good meh?&quot;

        &quot;Nevermind, you decide!&quot;

      <Title order={1}>What is GoodMeh?</Title>
      <Text>
        Using some serious tech magic (read: advanced AI and machine learning),
        GoodMeh analyzes thousands of real customer reviews to spot authentic
        experiences and filter out the noise.
        <br />
        Think of our algorithms as your friendly lobang king who remembers every
        good (and not-so-good) place they&apos;ve ever visited, but without the
        bias. We don&apos;t just look at star ratings - anyone can give 5 stars,
        right?
        <br />
        Instead, we dive deep into what people actually say about their
        experiences.

      <Title order={1}>What Makes Us Different?</Title>
      <Text>
        Our mission is simple: help you find your next favorite spot without the
        usual headache. Instead of listening to influencers or paid reviews, we
        tap into something more powerful: the real experiences of everyday
        Singaporeans like you.
        <br />

        might not have the fanciest Instagram feed but will make your taste buds
        super happy. Tell us a few places you already love, and we&apos;ll help
        you discover similar spots that match your taste.
        <br />
        No paid promotions
        <br />
        No sponsored content
        <br />
        No influencer bias
        <br />
        Just real recommendations based on real experiences
