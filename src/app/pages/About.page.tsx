            Always this dreaded statement when trying to decide where to go.

          <Title>What is GoodMeh?</Title>
          <Text>
            Using some serious tech magic (read: advanced AI and machine
            learning), GoodMeh analyzes thousands of real customer reviews to
            spot authentic experiences and filter out the noise.
            <br />
            <br />
            Think of our algorithms as your friendly lobang king who remembers
            every good (and not-so-good) place they&apos;ve ever visited, but
            without the bias. We don&apos;t just look at star ratings - anyone
            can give 5 stars, right?
            <br />
            <br />
            Instead, we dive deep into what people actually say about their
            experiences.

          <Title order={1}>What Makes Us Different?</Title>
          <Text>
            Our mission is simple: help you find your next favorite spot without
            the usual headache. Instead of listening to influencers or paid
            reviews, we tap into something more powerful: the real experiences
            of everyday Singaporeans like you.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our smart system cuts through the noise to find those hidden gems
            that might not have the fanciest Instagram feed but will make your
            taste buds super happy. Tell us a few places you already love, and
            we&apos;ll help you discover similar spots that match your taste.
            <br />
            <br />
            No paid promotions
            <br />
            <br />
            No sponsored content
            <br />
            <br />
            No influencer bias
            <br />
            <br />
            Just real recommendations based on real experiences
